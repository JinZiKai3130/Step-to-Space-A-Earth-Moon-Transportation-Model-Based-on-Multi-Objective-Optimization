Q: What are the steps for implementing the Pareto optimal algorithm?
A:

Define the objective functions, clarifying the goals to be optimized.

Generate or collect a set of candidate solutions for evaluation.

Calculate objective values, assessing each solution’s performance across all objective functions.

Judgment Method 1 – Naïve Comparison

Pseudocode example
Pareto Optimal Set = []
for Solution A in all solutions:
is_dominated = False
for Solution B in all solutions:
if Solution B dominates Solution A: # Solution B is no worse than A in all objectives and better in at least one
is_dominated = True
break
if not is_dominated:
Add Solution A to Pareto Optimal Set

Judgment Method 2 – Fast Non-dominated Sorting
Determine dominance relationships first, then perform hierarchical sorting.
